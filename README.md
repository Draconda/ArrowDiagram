# ArrowDiagram
When we make a plan for a project, we sometimes make arrow diagram, and get the earliest event time & latest event time, critical path, and margin of days. when the number of milestones for projects delay or stop, we need to make arrow diagram again.
So I made the simple auto-ArrowDiagram-making-algorithm, which can plot a graph of Arrow Diagram, calculate the earliest event time, latest event time, find critical path, and get margin of days.
